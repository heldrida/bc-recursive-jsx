                      "answer": "<answer><p><glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> introduced a new regime for company communications, a key aim of which was to facilitate the use of electronic communications.  However, the provisions are not limited to electronic communications and govern all communications by and to companies which are made under the <glossary definition=\"has the meaning given in s 2 CA 2006 (ie the company law provisions of CA 2006 (being Parts 1 to 39, and 45 to 47 so far as they apply for the purposes of those Parts); Part 2 CAICEA 2004; and the provisions of CA 1985 and CCCPA 1985 that remain in force)\">Companies Acts</glossary> (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861213\">4</a>).</p><p>Limited provision had been made under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 1985\">CA 1985</glossary> for the use of electronic communications in specified circumstances (including in relation to notices of meeting, proxy appointments and the circulation of annual accounts and reports).  However, there was no general provision covering company communications, leading to uncertainty as to whether electronic communications could be used in other circumstances.  In addition, the <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 1985\">CA 1985</glossary> provisions required the active consent of members to electronic communications in all circumstances.  As a result, take-up of these methods of communication was patchy.</p><p>In contrast, the company communications provisions of <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> are designed to encourage take-up of one type of electronic communication in particular: by website.  Where a company wishes to communicate documents or information by means of a website it can, subject to certain conditions, treat consent to receiving information in that form as having been given (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861254\">33</a>).  In broad terms, this means that members must actively opt out of accepting communications via a website if that is the method of communication which the company wishes to use.  As a result, companies can benefit from the cost savings and speed offered by electronic delivery.  In addition, members and others are not burdened with unwanted hard copies of company information.  </p><p>Even though website communication is encouraged, there are protections to ensure that a company cannot unilaterally decide that it will only communicate electronically.  Anyone giving active or deemed consent to electronic communications is entitled to revoke their agreement at any time.  In addition, there is a general right for members to be provided with a hard copy of documents communicated electronically (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861270\">48</a>).</p></answer>",

It is important to note that many sections of <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> expressly refer to, or tacitly require the use of, the company communications provisions.  A failure to comply with the company communications provisions in these circumstances will mean that the statutory provision authorising or requiring the communication in question has also been breached.</p><p>As mentioned above, the communication of documents or information authorised or required by <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> is governed by the company communications provisions, subject to any applicable limitations or variations.  For example, to the extent expressly permitted by <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>, a company’s articles of association may vary certain of the company communications provisions (as discussed in Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861215\">6</a>).

However, the fact that the company communications provisions are generally applicable means that companies already in existence when the <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> regime came into force do not need to amend their articles to take advantage of the company communications provisions, although there may be advantages in doing so (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861305\">74</a>).</p><p>A number of terms are defined for the purposes of the company communications provisions by <legislation>s 1168 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1168 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861222\">12</a>).  </p><p>It is worth remembering that as well as the company communications provisions, <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> contains separate, but potentially overlapping, provisions as to service of documents on companies and their officers which are not limited to documents authorised or required to be sent or supplied under the <glossary definition=\"has the meaning given in s 2 CA 2006 (ie the company law provisions of CA 2006 (being Parts 1 to 39, and 45 to 47 so far as they apply for the purposes of those Parts); Part 2 CAICEA 2004; and the provisions of CA 1985 and CCCPA 1985 that remain in force)\">Companies Acts</glossary> (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861208\">1</a>).</p><p>For the meaning of ‘company communications provisions’ see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861212\">3</a>.</p></answer>",

                      "answer": "<answer><p>No, the company communications provisions potentially apply to other bodies corporate too.  </p><p>There are two definitions of ‘company’ in use in relation to company communications, which can make the scope of the company communications provisions a little unclear on first reading.  The issue is discussed in more detail below but, to summarise, the company communications provisions: (a) govern communications under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> <em>by or to</em> a ‘company’ (as narrowly defined in <legislation>s 1 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>); and (b) in the case of communications <em>to</em> such a company, govern communications under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> sent by any body corporate (by reason of the extended definition of ‘company’ in <legislation>s 1148(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1148(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>).  </p><p>The reasoning behind this interpretation of the legislation is as follows.  In the company communications provisions, ‘company’ includes any body corporate (<legislation>s 1148(1)<legislation-reference>s 1148(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>).  ‘Body corporate’ is defined in <legislation>s 1173(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1173(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>.  The extended definition in <legislation>s 1148(1)<legislation-reference>s 1148(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> means that the company communications provisions may affect not just companies formed and registered under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> (or predecessor legislation) within the meaning of <legislation>s 1<legislation-reference>s 1 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> but also, for example, companies incorporated in other jurisdictions and other bodies corporate such as <glossary definition=\"limited liability partnership\">LLP</glossary>s.  </p><p>The extended definition in <legislation>s 1148(1)<legislation-reference>s 1148(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> does not have as great a scope as might first appear.

For example, a USB stick or CD-ROM contains information in an electronic form that can be sent by post.  A text message would appear to fall within the definition of electronic means and satisfy the other requirements for ‘electronic form’.  The additional requirement that the recipient must be able to retain a copy of the document or information must always be taken into account and may, in practice, preclude the use of some electronic means of communication (although it appears that a copy that can only be retained in electronic form will satisfy the requirement).  In the editors’ view, a telephone call does not qualify as a communication in ‘electronic form’ (although a telephone number may constitute an ‘electronic address’ for other purposes: see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861238\">23</a>).</p><p>The requirement that the sender or supplier ‘reasonably considers’ that the recipient can read and retain a copy of the communication in that form must also be observed.  This will be a question of fact in each case but, in particular, companies communicating by electronic means should bear in mind that recipients’ computer equipment and software may be less comprehensive and up-to-date than their own.  As such, it may not be reasonable to assess recipients’ ability to read and retain communications simply by reference to the company’s systems. </p></answer>",

The role of a company secretary can vary from company to company depending on the nature and size of the organisation.  For many smaller private companies, the role of a company secretary is predominantly administrative, eg maintaining the statutory registers of the company and ensuring compliance with filing requirements under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>.  Failure to perform some of these functions may attract a penalty under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>.</p><p>The <glossary definition=\"White Paper [Cm 6456] published on 17 March 2005\">White Paper 2005: Company Law Reform</glossary> recognised the importance of the role for private companies in this regard.  Employing a company secretary ensures that someone is focusing on compliance with administrative, yet legal, requirements, and therefore the risk of incurring potential penalties for non-compliance is reduced (Annex A, Regulatory Impact Assessment, page 279).  However, for the vast majority of smaller companies, a company secretary was considered unnecessary (<glossary definition=\"White Paper [Cm 6456] published on 17 March 2005\">White Paper 2005: Company Law Reform</glossary>, paragraph 4.5), and the recommendation to remove the requirement for private companies to appoint a company secretary was adopted from 6 April 2008.</p><p>It was left open to private companies to appoint a secretary should they wish, and the <glossary definition=\"White Paper [Cm 5553] published on 16 July 2002\">White Paper 2002: Modernising Company Law</glossary> (paragraph 6.6 part 2) envisaged that some private companies would still appoint a company secretary.

                  "answer": "<answer><p>The answer to this question will depend on precisely what the articles of association say.  </p><p>As seen in Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435017_Toc402171632\">5</a>, if the articles expressly require a private company to have a company secretary then it will need to appoint one at all times.  However, some articles may contain provisions relating to a company secretary, but which do not necessarily expressly require the company to appoint one.</p><p>In August 2006, the government consulted on the application of the <glossary definition=\"the draft legislation presented to parliament for debate which, having completed all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent, became CA 2006\">Companies Bill</glossary> to existing companies on issues related to the constitution (see ‘Paper seeking views on the application of the <glossary definition=\"the draft legislation presented to parliament for debate which, having completed all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent, became CA 2006\">Companies Bill</glossary> to existing companies’).  In that consultation it recognised that some private companies will have specific provisions in their articles either <em>requiring</em> the company to appoint a secretary (as referred to in Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435017_Toc402171632\">5</a>), or <em>assuming</em> that it has one (see paragraphs 51, 52 and 53).  As a result of the consultation, it was decided that such provisions should continue to have effect following the implementation of the provisions of <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> which do not require a private company to have a secretary (see ‘Results of consultation on the application of the <glossary definition=\"the draft legislation presented to parliament for debate which, having completed all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent, became CA 2006\">Companies Bill</glossary> to existing companies on issues related to the constitution - summary of responses and the government’s conclusions’, question 11).  It was not discussed what the specific provisions in the articles might be that <em>assume</em> that a company has a secretary.</p><p>While only directly applicable to private companies incorporated before 6 April 2008 (the date of removal of the statutory requirement for private companies to appoint a secretary), it is useful to look at the transitional provision in paragraph 4(2) Schedule 4 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006 (Commencement No. 5, Transitional Provisions and Savings) Order 2007 (SI 2007/3495)\">Fifth Commencement Order</glossary> for guidance.  This states that a provision in the articles ‘requiring or authorising things to be done by or in relation to a secretary’, or ‘as to the manner in which, or terms on which, a secretary is to be appointed or removed’, are not provisions expressly requiring a company to appoint a secretary. </p><p>From this it follows that, for any private company (either in existence before 6 April 2008 or incorporated on or following that date), drafting going further than including the terms of appointment or removal of a secretary, or setting out the requirements as to the functions of a secretary, may mean that the company is required to appoint a company secretary.  In these circumstances, it would be prudent to amend the articles to remove the relevant provisions, unless the members specifically wish to oblige the directors to appoint a company secretary at all times.</p><p>Note that a private company is not required to have a company secretary simply because it has (unamended) <glossary definition=\"Table A: Schedule to Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/805)\">CA 1985 Table A</glossary> articles (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435017_Toc402171631\">4</a>), and there is no provision in the (unamended) <glossary definition=\"Model Articles for Private Companies Limited by Shares: Schedule 1 Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/3229)\">CA 2006 Model Articles (Private: shares)</glossary> or (Private: guarantee) that require a private company to appoint a company secretary (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435017_Toc402171634\">7</a>).</p></answer>",

                  "question": "<question id=\"_Toc402171636\">Why might a private company choose to have a company secretary? </question>",
                  "answer": "<answer><p>A private company may choose to appoint a company secretary even though it is not required to do so by law (<legislation>s 270(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 270(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>).  The principal reason why a private company might make an appointment is because the functions usually carried out by a company secretary (when all companies were obliged to appoint one) still need to be administered.  Failure to perform some of these functions may attract a penalty under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>, eg the failure to file an annual return on time under <legislation>s 858 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 858 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> (see [Section: Company names, business names and publicity/Annual return]).</p><p>In the absence of a company secretary, the burden of performing these functions will fall to the directors unless they delegate the functions to others (see below).  This will have an impact on the time spent on their principal role of directing and managing the company and its business.</p><p>See Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171708\">76</a> for further discussion of the usual functions of a company secretary.</p><p>Another reason why a private company might choose to appoint a company secretary is to encourage and promote good corporate governance.  While principally the responsibility of the directors, and of more importance for public companies (especially those with publicly traded securities), many larger private companies may still want to be seen to promote good corporate governance in order to enhance their reputations, gain credibility with external stakeholders and thereby add value to the company.  A company secretary could be appointed to take on a similar role to that of a public company secretary in relation to corporate governance (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171709\">77</a> in this regard).</p><p>In practice, the factors which might prompt the appointment of a company secretary are likely to be more prevalent in respect of larger private companies.  Joint venture companies also commonly appoint a company secretary.  This role can be strategically important since the joint venture party providing the secretary would usually have custody of the statutory registers of the company and responsibility for circulating notices of all company meetings.  As a result, the right of nomination of the company secretary may have to be rotated between the parties from time to time.</p><p>Smaller private companies which choose not to make an appointment should give due consideration as to who will carry out the functions usually reserved to the secretary.  There is flexibility on this, and these functions could be delegated to one person or shared out among several, but it would always be prudent to ensure that the arrangements are clear so that all administrative responsibilities are met.</p><p>If a private company chooses to have a company secretary then the provisions of <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> which apply to private companies with a secretary will apply to that company and secretary.

In the editors’ view, not being capable of acting means something more than a company secretary simply being unavailable to carry out his functions for a short period of time, for example if he is away on holiday.  In these circumstances, the company secretary would not be incapable of carrying out his functions, it would just not be as practical or convenient to do so as when he were at work.  As a result, in this situation, it would not be possible for the assistant or deputy secretary to step into the shoes of the appointed company secretary, nor for the directors to authorise any person to act instead.  In the editors’ view, for a company secretary to be not capable of acting under <legislation>s 274<legislation-reference>s 274 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>, he would need to be, for example, incapacitated by an illness or accident that has left him hospitalised.</p><p>This view is not altered by the fact that the section heading to <legislation>s 274<legislation-reference>s 274 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> refers to the secretary being ‘unable’ to act, which arguably imposes a less strict test than not being capable of acting.</p><p>It is an accepted principle of statutory interpretation that a section heading does form part of an Act of Parliament (in this case <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>) and should be considered in the interpretation process (see further at Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171724\">89</a>).  However, this does not, in the editors’ view, support seeking to construe the heading to <legislation>s 274<legislation-reference>s 274 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> as overriding the wording used in the substantive text of that section, especially where this significantly expands the ambit of the provision.</p><p>Companies would therefore be advised to regard <legislation>s 274<legislation-reference>s 274 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> as being applicable only in rare and unusual circumstances, and not to have recourse to this as a matter of routine simply where the secretary is otherwise engaged.</p><p>In <legislation>s 274(b)<legislation-reference>s 274(b) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> there is also a reference to an assistant or deputy secretary not being capable of acting.  The same principles would presumably apply, although in practice (especially for smaller private companies) there may often simply be no assistant or deputy secretary appointed.

This means that their authority and/or liability will be joint, and they will carry out their duties together.  Each will be fully authorised to carry out, and each liable for, the performance of all company secretarial duties with which they are charged. </p><p>Joint secretaries appointed on this basis will therefore work very closely together.  In particular, all joint secretaries will have to sign the forms to be filed at Companies House and any other notices and documents.  This makes it important in practice to consider the personalities of the persons appointed as joint secretaries to ensure that they are capable of working effectively together. </p><p>However, <legislation>s 44 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 44 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> should be noted.  This section governs the valid execution of a document by a company, and helps to protect a ‘purchaser’ (as defined in <legislation>s 44(5)<legislation-reference>s 44(5) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>) in its dealings with the company.  <legislation>S 44<legislation-reference>s 44 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> provides that a purchaser can presume that a document is validly executed by a company in certain circumstances, one of which is when the document is signed on behalf of the company by a director, and also by a company secretary or ‘any’ joint secretary.  As ‘any’ joint secretary may sign, this section suggests that only one joint secretary needs to sign the document, rather than both or all of them (if more than two).  This could potentially conflict with the ‘joint’ basis of the company secretaries’ appointment, and a company may find itself unintentionally bound to an arrangement where internal procedures (ie all joint secretaries acting together) have not been complied with.  </p><p>In reality, this situation is unlikely to arise as a director needs to sign the document, and the director would (presumably) act in accordance with the board’s intentions.  In the interests of good practice, it would be worth clarifying the position regarding internal authority to sign documents on the company’s behalf, especially if one joint secretary is to have authority to sign without the other.  This could be done in the articles of association, the board resolution appointing the joint company secretaries (or passed specifically for a particular situation), or in the secretaries’ terms of employment (if any, see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171672\">43</a> on whether a company secretary needs a written agreement on appointment).</p><p>In the same vein, if the company intends that other tasks are to be divided between jointly appointed company secretaries, this intention and details of the division of tasks should be made clear in the articles, the board resolution appointing the joint secretaries or the terms of their appointment (if any) in order to avoid any potential misunderstanding.

In order for it to be such notice, it must be shown that it was his duty to the first company to communicate his knowledge to the second company. </p><p>Similarly, notice received by a company secretary in his private capacity as an individual, and not in the course of a company’s business, is not necessarily valid notice to the company: <em><case-reference>The Société Générale de Paris v Janet Walker (1885) 11 App Cas 20, HL<canonical-case-reference>The Société Générale de Paris v Janet Walker (1885) 11 App Cas 20, HL</canonical-case-reference></case-reference></em>.</p><p>In practice, such issues arise principally in relation to smaller, private companies which choose to appoint a company secretary.  In public companies (especially those with publicly traded securities) and larger private companies, the role of a company secretary is likely to involve a significant workload, leaving little time for an appointment elsewhere (other than to companies within the same group, where these issues should be capable of appropriate management).  In any event, it would be usual for a company secretary in such an organisation to seek express permission and/or declare any potential conflict of interest prior to taking up an additional appointment of any nature.</p><p>See Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171708\">76</a> for further discussion of the usual functions of a company secretary and Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171709\">77</a> for the role of a company secretary in corporate governance.</p></answer>",

However, this sweep-up provision would not appear to extend to the directors, or other employees, of a corporate secretary.

This indicates that the obligation is not so onerous as to involve excessive expenditure, or requiring the directors to devote a disproportionate amount of time to the task of appointing a company secretary, taking them away from their main role of running the business effectively.  </p><p>It is the editors’ view that, in practice, what ‘all reasonable steps’ means will vary from company to company according to its size, the nature of the company’s business and the extent of the duties the company intends the secretary to carry out.
